### I don't read books often, but...
There's a book I want to mention. I'm still reading through it, but it has already enlightened my perspective on a few issues. This book, "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is by Dale Carnegie, published 80 years ago.

I've never heard of this book until yesterday -- I was just browsing the daily digest on my personalized Quora feed and came across a question that asked how a junior software developer should advance in their career. Most answers had listed a range of computer science/software development topics to study (now, they're topics I plan on studying soon), but one answer had listed this book near the top of their list. It was an answer that didn't fit with the others; it stood out, and I was curious why such an answer was listed. Naturally, I searched online for the book.
